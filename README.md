# Python-Application
  This project represents a simple application for network monitoring (clone of Wireshark App). I wanted to make a project like this to expland my knowledge of Python and of networking, JSON etc.
  
  Technologies used:
  -----------------------------------
  - Python, module like: tkinter, scapy, matplotlib, json
  - PyCharm
  
  How the application work?
  -------------------------------
  My app has a button "Captura" which captures all network interfaces, also the user can add a filter to sort the networks. The capture is a Singleton patttern class to ensure that a single instance of a capture is made at a time.
  
  This software contains a button "Save as JSON" that allows to save all the packages captured in a JSON file and a button named "Show statistics" that display a Pie Chart which represents the statistics related to numbers of packages of a type.
  
  Possible improvements
  ---------------------------
  - more features like improved design, more informations about the networks captured.


  How to launch application
  -------------------------------
  1. Check that you have Python 3.9 and Pycharm
  2. Cloeth code: 
  3. Run the code in Pycharm
  4. Ready!
